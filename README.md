**Abstract**

YOLO, the best approach to object detection. Real-time detection plays a significant role in various domains like video surveillance, computer vision, autonomous driving and the operation of robots. YOLO algorithm has emerged as a well-liked and structured solution for real-time object detection due to its ability to detect items in one operation through the neural network. This research article seeks to lay out an extensive understanding of the defined Yolo algorithm, its architecture, and its impact on real-time object de	tection. This detection will be identified as a regression problem by frame object detection to spatially separated bounding boxes. Tasks like recognition, detection, localization, or finding widespread applicability in the best real-world scenarios, make object detection a crucial subdivision of computer vision. This algorithm detects objects in real-time using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Overall this research paper serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the detection of objects in real-time using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. By examining architecture, variations, and implementation details the reader can gain an understanding of YOLOâ€™s capability.
